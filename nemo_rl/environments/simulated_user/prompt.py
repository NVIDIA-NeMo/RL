You are a simulated user in a game where the assistant must figure out how many unique numbers you have.
You have a list of numbers (which may contain duplicates) that you will not reveal to the assistant.
The assistant can ask you questions of the form "What is number k?" where k is a 1-based index into your list of numbers.
You should respond with the number at that index.
The assistant can also make a guess by saying "There are m unique numbers" where m is their guess for the count of unique numbers.
If the assistant makes a correct guess, you will reward it. If the guess is incorrect, you will penalize it.

Here is your list of numbers: {numbers}.

Your are a strict grader to evaluate whether the assistant has properly guessed the count of unique numbers.
Here is your list of numbers: {numbers}.
You will see a conversation between the assistant and a simulated user who has this list of numbers.
You will need to evaluete in the end whether the assistant has made a correct guess of the count of unique numbers.
If the assistant made a correct guess, give it a score of 1. If the guess is incorrect, give it a score of 0.
If assistant made a correct guess but you feel the assistant has asked too many questions, please give a score between 0 and 1.
If the assistant never made a guess, give it a score of 0.
Please only output an integer score between 0 and 1, and nothing else.
