# Dynamo Integration

This document describes how [NVIDIA Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo)
is integrated into NeMo-RL as a generation backend, and the overall structure of
that integration as it currently stands.

> **Status:** Active development on the `dynamo-k8s-integration` branch.
> Kubernetes-only. The nemo-gym HTTP rollout path, token-ID
> `generate()` / `generate_async()` path, and ModelExpress v2 mid-training
> weight refit are wired end-to-end; see
> [Current State and Limitations](#current-state-and-limitations) for what is
> and isn't supported.

## What the integration does

A `DynamoGraphDeployment` (DGD) becomes the generation backend for RL training.
This decouples generation from the trainer: inference is an independent,
Kubernetes-managed deployment, and the trainer dispatches generation work to its
frontend over HTTP. It is the natural fit for **non-colocated** RL and for
[nemo-gym](nemo-gym-integration.md)-style agentic rollouts, which already speak
OpenAI-compatible HTTP. The same backend can also service direct token-ID
generation through Dynamo's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` route.

The key thing to understand is the **division of ownership**, which is
deliberately lopsided:

- **The DGD owns everything inference.** The dynamo operator brings up and owns
  the entire stack — frontend, workers, etcd, NATS — and owns all engine
  arguments (model, TP, parsers, `max_model_len`, …). NeMo-RL never sees them.
- **NeMo-RL owns almost nothing on the serving side.** It resolves the frontend
  URL and dispatches to it. The generation backend is a thin client; the only
  trainer→DGD coupling beyond the rollout URL is the weight-refit path.

So the two integration surfaces worth your attention are: (1) **how the trainer
finds and talks to the DGD frontend** (config + URL resolution), and (2) **how
freshly-trained weights get into the DGD workers each step** (ModelExpress v2 over
NIXL). Everything else is standard Dynamo.

```

Two data planes connect the trainer and the DGD:

1. **Rollout / generation path (HTTP).** nemo-gym dispatches agentic rollout
   requests to the DGD frontend's OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint. Direct
   NeMo-RL `generate()` and `generate_async()` calls use the DGD frontend's
   `/v1/completions` route with token-ID prompts. The frontend load-balances
   across workers.
2. **Weight-refit path (NIXL RDMA, optional).** When `cluster.weight_sync.method
   = "mx"`, the trainer publishes new weights to the ModelExpress (MX) server each
   step and each DGD worker RDMA-pulls them. See
   [Weight Refit via ModelExpress v2](#weight-refit-via-modelexpress-v2).

## NeMo-RL Side

### `DynamoGeneration` backend

`nemo_rl/models/generation/dynamo/dynamo_generation.py` defines
`DynamoGeneration`, which implements `GenerationInterface` directly (it does *not*
extend `VllmGeneration`). It is selected via `policy.generation.backend = "dynamo"`
through the factory in `nemo_rl/models/generation/__init__.py`.

It is essentially a URL forwarder plus a refit dispatcher:

- **Construction** resolves the cluster-internal frontend URL. Either:
  - `dynamo_cfg.dgd_name` — derives
    `http://<dgd_name>-frontend.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>/v1` from the
    dynamo operator's stable Service naming. Requires running inside a Kubernetes
    pod (checked via `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`). nrl-k8s stamps this field
    automatically.
  - `dynamo_cfg.frontend_url` — an explicit reachable URL (escape hatch for
    non-default Service names, NodePort/Ingress, or running outside Kubernetes).
    This disables the in-pod check.

  The resolved URL is exposed as `dp_openai_server_base_urls`, which nemo-gym
  reads to dispatch rollouts.

- **Lifecycle methods** (`prepare_for_generation`, `finish_generation`,
  `shutdown`) are no-ops — the DGD lifecycle is owned by Kubernetes.
- **`generate()`** performs synchronous token-ID generation by POSTing one
  `/v1/completions` request per prompt. It sends `prompt` as token IDs,
  `return_tokens_as_token_ids: true`, `include_stop_str_in_output: true`, and
  `nvext.extra_fields: ["completion_token_ids"]`, then reconstructs the standard
  `GenerationOutputSpec` tensor shape from the returned completion token IDs.
- **`generate_async()`** performs the same completion request in an async wrapper.
  It intentionally accepts one sample at a time, matching the vLLM async worker
  contract used by the rollout code. It also budgets `max_tokens` against
  `vllm_cfg.max_model_len` so direct Dynamo generation has the same context
  truncation behavior expected by NeMo-RL.
- **Sampling behavior** mirrors the existing vLLM backend knobs: non-greedy
  requests forward `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` from
  `policy.generation`; `top_k: null` becomes `-1` for the Dynamo/vLLM HTTP API.
  Greedy requests send `temperature: 0.0` and `top_k: 1`. Config-level
  `stop_strings`, per-sample `stop_strings`, and `stop_token_ids` are forwarded
  to the DGD.
- **Direct-generation limits:** only token-ID LLM prompts are supported. The
  direct path rejects multimodal `vllm_content`, requires
  `dynamo_cfg.request_timeout_s`, and requires a Dynamo image that returns
  `nvext.completion_token_ids` from `/v1/completions`.
- **Collective / IPC weight-sync methods** (`init_collective`,
  `update_weights_from_collective`, `update_weights_via_ipc_zmq`) raise
  `NotImplementedError` — non-colocated refit goes through MX.
- **`__getstate__` / `__setstate__`** make the object picklable so async rollouts
  can ship the `GenerationInterface` across Ray actors.

### Config

`nemo_rl/models/generation/dynamo/config.py`:

- `DynamoCfg` (the `policy.generation.dynamo_cfg` block):
  | Field | Purpose |
  |---|---|
  | `dgd_name` | `metadata.name` of the DGD; used to derive the frontend URL. |
  | `frontend_url` | Explicit URL (mutually exclusive with `dgd_name`; wins if both set). |
  | `namespace` | K8s namespace (auto-resolved from the pod if omitted). |
  | `frontend_port` | Frontend HTTP port (default `8000`). |
  | `request_timeout_s` | HTTP timeout for direct `generate()` / `generate_async()` completion requests. |

- `DynamoConfig(GenerationConfig)` adds `dynamo_cfg` plus `vllm_cfg` /
  `vllm_kwargs` *compatibility shims* — the DGD owns the real inference-engine
  args, but nemo-gym today reads `cfg["vllm_cfg"]["max_model_len"]` directly, so
  those fields are retained (not authoritative).

Tool-call and reasoning parsers are also serving-side concerns. Configure them on
the DGD worker with `--dyn-tool-call-parser` and `--dyn-reasoning-parser`, not in
`policy.generation.dynamo_cfg`.

## nrl-k8s Orchestration

`infra/nrl_k8s` is the orchestration layer that brings up the DGD and wires the
recipe to it before the training entrypoint runs.

- **DGD ingestion** (`src/nrl_k8s/dgd.py`): loads a standalone DGD manifest
  (`load_dgd_manifest`), deep-merges `overrides`, patches cross-cutting `infra`
  fields (image, imagePullSecrets, serviceAccount, labels) into each service's
  `extraPodSpec` (`build_dgd_manifest`), and provides create-or-replace CRUD plus
  `wait_for_dgd_ready` (waits for `status.state == "successful"` and all pods
  Ready). CRD identifiers: `nvidia.com/v1alpha1`, kind `DynamoGraphDeployment`.
- **Schema** (`src/nrl_k8s/schema.py`): `DynamoGraphSpec` (`manifest`, `name`,
  `overrides`, `labels`, `readyTimeoutS`, …); `InfraConfig.dynamo` is a
  `dict[str, DynamoGraphSpec]` of named DGDs declared by the run.
- **Orchestration** (`src/nrl_k8s/orchestrate.py`): `ensure_dgd` applies the
  manifest idempotently (warns on drift, recreates on `--recreate`), optionally
  attaches an `ownerReference` so the DGD is GC'd with the training RayCluster,
  and waits for readiness. When exactly one DGD is declared, nrl-k8s stamps
  `policy.generation.dynamo_cfg.dgd_name` into the recipe automatically (the infra
  YAML's entrypoint passes `+policy.generation.dynamo_cfg.dgd_name=<name>`).

### Config files

A runnable k8s exemplar is described by a recipe/infra pair under
`infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/*/*.yaml`. Start from those files; the
infra YAML references the matching DGD manifest internally.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/*/*.yaml` | **Recipe + infra exemplars** — recipe YAMLs set `policy.generation.backend: dynamo`, GRPO hyperparameters, and `cluster.weight_sync`; companion `*.infra.yaml` files set the training RayCluster, image, `dynamo:` block, and launch entrypoint. |

Current runnable exemplars:

- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/V1/*.yaml`: Qwen2.5 math + Dynamo + MX.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/V2/*.yaml`: Llama 3.1 8B instruct Megatron + Dynamo + MX.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/V3/*.yaml`: sliding puzzle + Dynamo + MX.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/V5/*.yaml`: Nemotron Nano v2 workplace-assistant Megatron + Dynamo + MX.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/V6/*.yaml`: Qwen3-8B-Base Megatron FP8 KV-cache + Dynamo + MX.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/k8s_exemplars/V7/*.yaml`: Qwen3-1.7B Megatron EAGLE3 + Dynamo + MX.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/grpo_workplace_assistant_dynamo_mx_gp.gb300.infra.yaml`
  plus `examples/nemo_gym/grpo_workplace_assistant_dynamo_mx_gp.yaml`:
  GlobalPlanner/GlobalRouter topology with two MX worker pools.
- `infra/nrl_k8s/examples/grpo_swe2_qwen3_30b_dynamo_mx.gb300.infra.yaml`
  plus `examples/nemo_gym/grpo_swe2_qwen3_30b_dynamo_mx.yaml`: SWE2
  Dynamo + MX replication path.

## Rollout Path

nemo-gym performs agentic rollouts by issuing OpenAI-compatible HTTP requests to
the URL(s) in `DynamoGeneration.dp_openai_server_base_urls`. Those requests hit
the DGD frontend, which routes them across `VllmDecodeWorker` replicas. NeMo-RL
is not in this loop beyond having resolved the URL — there is no per-token or
per-request involvement on the trainer side.

For non-nemo-gym code paths, `DynamoGeneration.generate()` and
`generate_async()` issue `/v1/completions` requests directly. This path is useful
for ordinary token-ID LLM rollouts and tests, but it is intentionally narrower
than vLLM's in-process backend: it does not support multimodal payloads, and it
depends on the Dynamo `/v1/completions` response carrying
`nvext.completion_token_ids`.

## Weight Refit via ModelExpress v2

The hard problem in non-colocated RL is getting freshly-trained weights from the
trainer into the inference workers each step, cross-node, without a shared NCCL
process group. The integration solves this with **ModelExpress v2 (MX)** over
**NIXL RDMA**. This is the cross-node analog of vLLM's
`update_weights_from_collective`. It is selected with `cluster.weight_sync.method
= "mx"` and is **pull-based**.

### Components

- **MX server** (`infra/nrl_k8s/dynamo_mx/modelexpress-server.yaml`) — a gRPC
  service (`:8001`) that holds source discovery state and a per-version tensor
  **shape registry**. Both the trainer and the workers must point at the same
  `mx_server_url`.
- **Trainer publishers**:
  - `DTensorPolicyWorker.stream_weights_via_mx`
    (`nemo_rl/models/policy/workers/dtensor_policy_worker.py`), built via
    `nemo_rl/distributed/mx_helpers.py::build_v2_publisher`.
  - `MegatronPolicyWorker.stream_weights_via_mx`
    (`nemo_rl/models/policy/workers/megatron_policy_worker.py`), which uses
    `nemo_rl/distributed/mx_megatron_helpers.py` to publish Megatron-native
    per-rank shards plus role metadata and a Megatron-Bridge sidecar.
- **Worker receiver** — each `VllmDecodeWorker` runs `MxRefitWorkerExtension`
  (registered on the dynamo side as `parallel_config.worker_extension_cls`,
  gated by `DYN_MX_REFIT_ENABLED=1`), which builds an `MxV2RefitReceiver`. The
  receiver code is baked into the Dynamo worker image; the retained k8s
  exemplars no longer copy a Python overlay from the NeMo-RL checkout at pod
  startup.
- **Refit dispatcher** — `_dispatch_update_weights_via_mx_remote` (a Ray remote
  in `dynamo_generation.py`) drives the per-worker refit over the workers'
  `/engine/<route>` admin HTTP server.

### MxConfig

`nemo_rl/distributed/mx_helpers.py::MxConfig` mirrors the
`cluster.weight_sync.mx_config` block. The trainer and workers must agree on these
because they encode the transfer contract:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `False` | Master switch; when off, refit falls back to NCCL collective. |
| `mx_server_url` | `modelexpress-server:8001` | gRPC URL of the MX server. |
| `timeout_seconds` | `300.0` | Max wait for source discovery / RDMA receive (also the dispatcher's retry deadline). |
| `same_rank_only` | `True` | Restrict transfers to trainer-rank-N → inference-rank-N pairs. **Required** on multi-subnet RDMA fabrics (GB200/GB300/EFA). |
| `tree_scale_out` | `True` | Receivers republish themselves as sources after refit, so later receivers pull from peers instead of the trainer's NIC. |
| `moe_expert_filter` | `True` | Receivers pull only the expert shards their EP rank owns (no-op for dense models). |
| `nic_pin` | `auto` | NUMA-local NIC pinning before NIXL init (`auto` / `off` / concrete `mlx5_<i>`). |

### Refit flow

The orchestration lives in `refit_policy_generation`
(`nemo_rl/algorithms/grpo.py`). The MX path is **serialized publish-then-pull**
(unlike the NCCL collective path, which must run concurrently or it deadlocks):

1. **Publish (trainer).** `policy.stream_weights_via_mx(version, mx_config)` runs
   on whichever policy backend is active:
   - **DTensor:** lazily builds an `MxV2TrainingPublisher`. The current
     implementation materializes DTensors with `full_tensor()` before publishing
     so the bytes match the global shape recorded in the registry; vLLM then
     applies its own TP sharding on load. This is functional but trades away the
     v2 no-allgather optimization.
   - **Megatron:** publishes Megatron-native local shards without allgather. Each
     tensor is classified into Megatron roles (`qkv_column`,
     `gated_mlp_column`, `column`, `row`, `vocab_parallel`, `replicated`,
     `expert_column`, `expert_row`) and carries enough sidecar metadata for the
     Dynamo receiver to translate the shard set into vLLM/HF-shaped weights.
   - Both paths call `publish(version)` then `mark_ready()`. The driver
     `ray.get`s the publish futures so publish fully completes before any
     receiver is triggered.
2. **Pull (workers).** `policy_generation.update_weights_via_mx(version,
   mx_config)` dispatches `_dispatch_update_weights_via_mx_remote`, which:
   - `GET <dgd-frontend>:8000/health` to enumerate live worker instances (keyed
     by stable `instance_id`), pairing each pod IP with `DYN_SYSTEM_PORT` (9090)
     to form the per-pod `system_url`. Retries with backoff on the first pass
     (workers may be container-Ready but not yet registered in discovery).
   - For each *new* worker: `POST /engine/update_weights_via_mx` (the real NIXL
     receive, blocks) → `POST /engine/flush_cache` (drop stale prefix cache).
     There is intentionally no pause/resume wrapper: vLLM `collective_rpc`
     executes between engine steps, pausing rather than aborting in-flight
     requests. The earlier `pause_generation` wrapper could abort rollouts and
     produce empty completions.
   - **Re-discovers** after each pass: if new `instance_id`s appeared (a worker
     scaled in or restarted mid-cycle), it refits those too, converging over up
     to 5 passes. Workers that disappeared mid-cycle are dropped (they can't be
     serving stale weights).
   - **Retries transient refit failures** until the shared cycle deadline. At
     scale (e.g. 16 workers), early receivers can fire inside the ~1s window
     between the trainer's `mark_ready()` and that READY status propagating into
     the server's `list_sources(status_filter=READY)` index, getting "no v2
     source available". As long as the dispatcher keeps running, the trainer
     stays blocked in `ray.get` and alive, so its heartbeat holds the sources
     READY and a re-issued refit finds them. Raising on the first failure instead
     would crash the trainer, STALE the sources, and doom every remaining worker.
   - Raises (failing the run loudly) on per-worker step errors or non-convergence
     — replacing the silent stale-weight failure mode of an earlier poll-only
     design.

### Megatron receive path

The Megatron path is separate from the DTensor/HF-shaped receive path. The
trainer publishes Megatron parameter names and role descriptors, and the DGD
worker builds a receiver context from:

- the target vLLM worker TP rank and TP size;
- the Megatron-Bridge sidecar (`megatron_transformer_config` and
  `megatron_hf_name_map`);
- the v2 shape registry and Megatron role metadata in each tensor descriptor.

The current Dynamo receiver supports **matched TP only** for Megatron refit: the trainer
TP size must match the DGD vLLM TP size. That keeps the receiver path simple:
each target TP rank pulls the matching trainer TP rank's buffers, handles
full-vocab tensors specially, runs the Modelexpress Megatron translator, loads
the translated weights into vLLM, and flushes stale caches. Cross-TP
repartitioning is a follow-up.

### RDMA fabric setup

NIXL RDMA over RoCE requires non-trivial pod plumbing, captured in the example
infra/DGD YAMLs (GB300):

- **RoCE DRA `resourceClaim`** on both the trainer worker pod and each DGD worker
  pod (nrl-k8s auto-creates the matching `ResourceClaimTemplate`). NIXL also needs
  pinned host memory, hence the `IPC_LOCK` capability on the trainer.
- **UCX env knobs**: `UCX_TLS=rc,cuda_copy` (restricted set — the broader set
  picks intra-host transports first and `prep_xfer_dlist` fails for cross-pod
  descriptors), `UCX_IB_GPU_DIRECT_RDMA=yes`, `UCX_CUDA_COPY_DMABUF=yes`,
  `MX_RDMA_NIC_PIN=auto`.
- **Images**: `infra/nrl_k8s/dynamo_mx/Dockerfile.nemorl` is the trainer image
  helper. `infra/nrl_k8s/dynamo_mx/Dockerfile` is an optional Dynamo worker image
  helper that pins the ModelExpress client/NIXL layer on top of a compatible
  Dynamo integration base image. The DGD worker image must have modelexpress, the
  UCX-bundled NIXL wheel, tokenize/completion-token support, and
  `MxRefitWorkerExtension` baked in. The retained manifests do not copy a Dynamo
  source overlay into pods at runtime. Trainer and worker nixl/modelexpress
  versions must align.

## Current State and Limitations

- **Kubernetes-only.** The `dgd_name` path requires running inside a pod;
  `frontend_url` is the only way to point at a DGD from outside.
- **Direct generation is token-ID only.** `generate()` and `generate_async()` are
  implemented through `/v1/completions`, but multimodal `vllm_content` is not
  supported. `generate_async()` accepts one sample per call.
- **Dynamo image requirement.** Direct generation and nemo-gym training require a
  Dynamo build that supports `/tokenize`, `required_prefix_token_ids`, and
  `nvext.completion_token_ids` on `/v1/completions` (the retained MX examples use
  the `jthomson04/tokenize-endpoint-merge-main-06-09` lineage).
- **MX refit supports DTensor and Megatron.** DTensor refit is functional but
  still allgathers each DTensor with `full_tensor()` before publish. Megatron
  refit publishes native local shards and currently requires matched trainer TP
  and DGD TP.
- **FP8 KV-cache scales** are supported on the Megatron MX matched-TP path used
  by V6. EAGLE lives under V7. DTensor MX FP8 KV-cache scales and cross-TP
  repartitioning remain unsupported.
- **No collective / IPC weight sync** for the Dynamo backend — MX is the only
  non-colocated refit mechanism.
