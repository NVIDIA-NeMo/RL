# NeMo RL Documentation

Welcome to the NeMo RL documentation. NeMo RL is an open-source post-training library developed by NVIDIA, designed to streamline and scale reinforcement learning methods for multimodal models (LLMs, VLMs, etc.).

This documentation provides comprehensive guides, examples, and references to help you get started with NeMo RL and build powerful post-training pipelines for your models.
