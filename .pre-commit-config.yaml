  # The rationale behind this pre-commit hook is that we want to ensure the config is minimized and matches
  # what you want merge in early otherwise you risk running one experiment, but when you merge the config
  # into upstream, you'll merge with the base config and that could be an experiment with different hyperparameters.
  # Anecdotally, this has been an issue when a SFT recipe runs without a custom chat_template, but when it merges with
  # the default one, it gets our recommended chat_template which is not what comes from the config.
  #
  # You can disable this pre-commit hook if you find this disruptive, but we will expect that the config
  # is minimized before accepting the recipe upstream.
