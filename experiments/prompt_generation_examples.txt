Calculate the total amount Alex had to pay in February.\n\nLet's think step-by-step<｜Assistant｜><think>\n"`

"To calculate Alex's total payment for February, I'll start by determining the cost of text messages. Alex sent 150 messages, and each costs $0.10, so the total text cost is 150 multiplied by $0.10.\n\nNext, I'll look at the talk time. Alex used 28 hours, which is 3 hours over the included 25 hours. The plan charges $0.15 for each extra minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the extra talk time in minutes is 3 hours multiplied by 60, which equals 180 minutes. Multiplying 180 minutes by $0.15 gives the overage cost for talk time.\n\nFinally, I'll add the text message cost and the overage talk time cost to find the total amount Alex had to pay.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's break down the costs step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of Text Messages:**\n   - **Number of Texts:** 150\n   - **Cost per Text:** \\$0.10\n   - **Total Cost for Texts:** \\( 150 \\times 0.10 = \\$15.00 \\)\n\n2. **Cost of Talk Time:**\n   - **Total Talk Time:** 28 hours\n   - **Included Talk Time:** 25 hours\n   - **Overtime Talk Time:** \\( 28 - 25 = 3 \\) hours\n   - **Overtime Minutes:** \\( 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\)\n   - **Cost per Overtime Minute:** \\$0.15\n   - **Total Overtime Cost:** \\( 180 \\times 0.15 = \\$27.00 \\)\n\n3. **Total Payment:**\n   - **Total Cost for Texts:** \\$15.00\n   - **Total Overtime Cost:** \\$27.00\n   - **Grand Total:** \\( 15.00 + 27.00 = \\$42.00 \\)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{42.00}\n\\]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"
